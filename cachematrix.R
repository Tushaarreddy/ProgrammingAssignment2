## Write a short comment describing this function
## makeCacheMAtrix is a function which creates a special "matrix" oblect that can cache its inverse for the input
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  j <- x$getInverse()
  if(!is.null(j)){
    message("getting cached data")
    return(j)
  }
  mat <- x$get()
  j <- solve(mat,...)
  x$setInverse(j)
  j
  
## cacheSolve is a function which computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache
## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
